  <h2>Just Enough Java</h2>
  <aside class="notes">
      Before I can start showing you the code that your apps are made of, you are going to need just a tiny bit of Java.

  <p>What does all this mean?</p>
<pre><code class ="java">package com.audreytroutt.androidbeginners.firstapp;

import android.app.Application;

public class MyFirstApplication extends Application {

  int toastLength = Toast.LENGTH_LONG;

  @Override
  public void onCreate() {
    super.onCreate();
    showToast("I have been created!");
  }

  public void showToast(String message) {
    Toast.makeText(this, message, Toast.LENGTH_LONG).show();
  }
}</code></pre>

      Really quick, here's what I mean by class, field, method, and comment.

  <p>Anything after // is a <strong class="green">comment</strong> in Java.</p>
  <pre><code contenteditable class ="java">// This is a comment</code></pre>
  <aside class="notes">
    Let's start with something easy: anything after double forward slashes is a comment. Comments should go BEFORE the thing you are talking about, but not on the same line!!

  <h2>Just Enough Java</h2>
  <p>Every line of code must end with a <strong class="green">semi-colon</strong>;</p>
  <pre><code contenteditable class ="java">int numberOfErrors = 0;</code></pre>
  <aside class="notes">
    Every line of code ends with a semi-colon. Android Studio will put a red error on your file if you forget your semi-colons--you can't compile your code without them.

  <h2>Just Enough Java</h2>
  <p class="left-align">Most things in Java are object.</p>
  <p class="left-align">A <strong class="green">class</strong> is the definition of an object in Java</p>
  <pre><code contenteditable class ="java">// this is a class
public class MyFirstApplication extends Application {
  // your fields and methods go in here
}</code></pre>
  <p class="left-align">All of your code goes inside of classes.</p>
  <aside class="notes">
    Everything in Java is an object and objects are defined by classes. This is an Application class called MyFirstApplication.
    <br>
    All of your code goes inside of classes.
    <br>
    You can see here that this says MyFirstApplication extends Application. That means MFA *is an* Application--it has all the fields and methods of Application PLUS anything added here in this file. This is known as inheritance.

  <h2>Just Enough Java</h2>
  <p class="left-align">A <strong class="green">method</strong> defines the behavior of your class.</p>
  <p class="left-align">Everything your app does will be defined inside of methods inside of classes.</p>
<pre><code contenteditable class ="java">public void showToast(String message) { // this is a method
  Toast.makeText(this, message, toastLength).show();
}</code></pre>
<aside class="notes">
  A method defines the behavior of your class. Your classes will have many methods. Everything your app does will be defined inside of methods inside of classes.

  Methods have visibility (public, private), return type (String, void), name (showToast), and maybe parameters (inside the parens)

  Here is a method called showToast that takes a message as a parameter. Inside the showToast method we call another method on a class called Toast to tell Android to display the little pop up message for the specified duration.

  <h2>Just Enough Java</h2>
  <p class="left-align">A <strong class="green">field</strong> holds some data for your object.</p>
<pre><code contenteditable class ="java">public class MyFirstApplication extends Application {

  int toastLength; // this is a field

  public void showToast(String message) {
    Toast.makeText(this, message, toastLength).show();
  }
}
</code></pre>
<p class="left-align" style="margin-top:20px;"><small class="yellow">
  PRO TIP: always put your fields at the top of your class, above any methods.
</small></p>
<aside class="notes">
  A field is where you can hold data for your object.
  <br>
  Fields have a type (View, int, String, long) and a name (like toastLength).
  <br>
  In this case my Application has a field called toastLength. It's an integer.
  <br>
  In my showToast method I'm using the value of toastLength to determine how long the toast message is displayed on the screen.

  <h2>Just Enough Java</h2>
  <p class="left-align">Up at the top above the class body there are two things you will see: the package and import declarations.</p>
<pre><code contenteditable class ="java">package com.audreytroutt.androidbeginners.firstapp;

import android.app.Application;
import android.widget.Toast;

import java.util.Date;
</code></pre>
  <p class="left-align"><strong class="green">package</strong> is like a folder path to your class--it will be auto-generated for you.</p>
  <p class="left-align"><strong class="green">import</strong> is used to include other code into your class.</p>

  <aside class="notes">
    Up at the top above the class body you will often see a lot of import statements. This is how you can make other code accessible to you in your class.
    <br>
    You usually don't have to type this yourself. I will show you how to automatically import based on Android Studio's suggestions.
    <br>
    On a mac the keyboard shortcut is option+return.
