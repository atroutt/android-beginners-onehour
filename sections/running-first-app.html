  <h2>Tour of Android Studio</h2>
  <p>There's a lot to see and do in Android Studio. Let's take a <a href="https://developer.android.com/studio/intro/index.html">brief tour</a> of the parts we will use in this course.</p>

  <aside class="notes">
    <p>Introduce these parts of Android Studio:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>The toolbar lets you carry out a wide range of actions, including running your app and launching Android tools.</li>
      <li>The navigation bar helps you navigate through your project and open files for editing. It provides a more compact view of the structure visible in the Project window.</li>
      <li>The editor window is where you create and modify code. Depending on the current file type, the editor can change. For example, when viewing a layout file, the editor displays the Layout Editor.</li>
      <li>The tool window bar runs around the outside of the IDE window and contains the buttons that allow you to expand or collapse individual tool windows.</li>
      <li>The tool windows give you access to specific tasks like project management, search, version control, and more. You can expand them and collapse them.</li>
      <li>The status bar displays the status of your project and the IDE itself, as well as any warnings or messages.</li>
    </ol>

  <h2>Create a New App</h2>
  <p>Set the name and package for your app. Choose a project location or use the suggested directory.</p>

  <aside class="notes">
    Packages are how your app is uniquely identified on the device and in the app stores. Usually they look like backwards urls, but they don't actually have to match a real website.

  <p class="left-align">If you haven't already, <br><a href="https://github.com/atroutt/android-beginners-onehour/archive/gh-pages.zip">download the source code for the first app</a> (zip).</p>
  <p class="left-align" style="margin-top:40px">Alternatively, download the repo using git:</p>
  <pre><code class ="bash">https://github.com/atroutt/android-beginners-onehour.git</code></pre>

  <h2>Gradle Sync</h2>
  <p class="left-align">Before you can run your first app, you need to make sure you have all the dependencies downloaded. To do that select "Sync Project with Gradle Files" from the top menu bar. This may take a minute.</p>
