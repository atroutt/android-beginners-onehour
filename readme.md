## Course description

This is a practical introduction to app development on Android. You are going to build five apps. At the end of this class you will know not only how to start a new app project, but also how some of the most common features in Android apps are implemented. You will get acquainted with standard Android, Google, and open source libraries for building Android apps. We will be writing code in Java and building, installing, and even sharing(!) apps.

I think it is just as important to build things from scratch as it is to understand existing code and take things apart. Therefore the coding exercises will be a combination of read and edit, build from pieces, and start from scratch.

**Cost:** $100

**Dates:** Saturday and Sunday, November 11-12, 2016 from 9:00 AM to 4:30 PM both days.

**Location:** Philadelphia, PA

You should be curious and excited to learn about how apps are built. You should be prepared to face challenges and have some fun along the way. You are not expected to have any previous Android or even Java experience for this class. However, to move things along it would help if this wasn't your very first introduction to programming in general.

(a) taken an intro programming class like intro to JavaScript through Girl Develop It, or
