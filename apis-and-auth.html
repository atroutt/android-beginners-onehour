<!-- APIs and Authentication  -->
<section>
  <h2>APIs and Authentication</h2>
  <p class="left-align">Most of the code that makes apps work isn't code you write yourself--instead we use libraries.</p>
  <p class="left-align">A library will provide an API for implementing the features you need.</p>
  <p class="left-align">API stands for Application Program Interface, and it means the classes and methods that you need to use to leverage all this code that other people wrote.</p>
  <aside class="notes">
    You've already learned a lot about the Android APIs when you learned about Application, Activity, and the Intent system.

  <h2>Dependencies</h2>
  <p class="left-align">Dependencies are libraries that your project needs to work.</p>
  <p class="left-align">You can add libraries manually by putting a copy of the library (usually a .jar or .aar file) in your project and instructing the gradle build script to include this file when it builds your app.</p>
  <p class="left-align">Or, you can use a <strong>dependency management system</strong>, like gradle, to automatically download and include the required libraries into your app.</p>
</section>
<section>
  <h2>build.gradle</h2>
  <p class="left-align">Gradle is both our build tool and our dependency managment system. The build.gradle script gives instructions for how to build the app and which dependencies to download and include.</p>

  <h2>Using Libraries</h2>
  <p class="left-align">Once you've added a library to your project, you need to know how to use it. There are four kinds of documentation for most libraries:</p>
  <ol>
    <li>Getting Started Instructions</li>
    <li>Formal API Documentation</li>
    <li>Feature Usage Guides</li>
    <li>Sample apps</li>
  </ol>
</section>
<section>
  <h2>Getting Started Instructions</h2>
  <p class="left-align">Getting started instructions usually tell you how to get the library and maybe how to initialize the main class.</p>

</section>
<section>
  <h2>Formal API Documentation</h2>
  <p class="left-align">Formal API documentation will list every class, method, and field in the API. Often these are in javadoc format.</p>
  <img src="img/auth-formal-api-docs.png"/>
</section>
<section>
  <h2>Feature Usage Guides</h2>
  <p class="left-align">Feature usage guides give you step by step instructions for how to use a specific feature of the API.</p>
  <img src="img/auth-feature-usage-docs.png"/>
</section>
<section>
  <h2>Sample Apps</h2>
  <p class="left-align">Sample apps are helpful because you can see a working example of the API.</p>

  <h2>How Authentication Works</h2>
  <p class="left-align">When we use an authentication service there are typically three steps:</p>
  <ol>
    <li>Send request for authentication using API</li>
    <li>Receive success token or failure response from auth service</li>
    <li>(Optional) Request additional user info with success token</li>
  </ol>

<section>
  <h2>Firebase</h2>
  <p class="left-align">Firebase is a service that can do authentication AND store data.</p>
  <p class="left-align">Rather than forcing your app users to remember a new username and password you can let them log in with Google instead.</p>
  <p class="left-align">You can authenticate with Google and then use the Google success token to authenticate with Firebase.</p>
